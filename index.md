Use links at the top of this page to access the main course resources (most were mentioned in the [Syllabus]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/about/#course-tools)).

<!--Read the ["Getting Started" announcement]({{site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/announcements) to know what to do before the first day of class.-->
<!--[Jump to the current week]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/calendar#week-1){: .btn .btn-blue }-->
