# ðŸŽ¯ Course Learning Objectives

By the end of CSW 8, students will have discussed, applied, and praciced working with the following course goals.

* Foundational programming concepts:
    - **Memory concepts**: variables, name, type, value, assignment statements, scope of variables, primitive vs. reference variables
    - **Primitive types**: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`
    - **Basic data structures**: lists, tuples, dictionaries, namedtutples, sets
    - **Control structures**: `if`/`else`/`elif`, `for` and `while` loops, nested loops
    - **Operations on Lists and Other Data Structures in Python**: index vs. value, finding sum, min, max, average, count of elements matching some condition, making a new structure of elements containing only those that match some condition.
    - **Functions**: function call vs. function definition, formal vs. actual parameters (arguments), recursive functions
    - **Input/output concepts**: Writing to the terminal, reading from the keyboard, reading and writing to files, neatly formatting output
* Problem solving strategies and code design:
    - breaking down a problem into a sequence of steps
    - abstracting specific problems into general ones, and
    - finding general solutions
* Debugging programs by:
    - predicting the output of programs or parts of code
    - generating test inputs and expected outputs based on the specification of a program, and writing test code
    - using print statements to localize program bugs
* Use an IDE to write and execute code.
* Write code that other people can read and understand.
* Explore the relevance of programming through real-world examples.
