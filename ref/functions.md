Hey folks!

Have you seen the template for creating a program with a function and the if-name-main section? 
We typed it for you, so you can simply copy-paste it when you need:
```
def function_name(parametr1, parametr2, ...):
    ret = ... # some calculation here, maybe for, maybe if
    return ret # do not forget the return :)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    var = input() # reading as many inputs as we need
    for ... # maybe some repeating?
    result = function_name(var, ..) # a function call, do not forget to store the result!
    print("This is the result '{}'".format(result)) #some cool format :)

```

Hope this will help you with the labs that have "create function" instructions inside.

Have a productive week!
